#### **Natural Language processing - Text Analysis Project** 

**Problem Statement**

Our goal Natural language processing(NLP)to classify the Customer reviews on variety of language-related tasks, including answering questions, classifying text in a variety of ways, and conversing with users.

In this project we applied sentiment analysis, machine learning techniques topic modelling and Deeplaerning techinques.

To address the problem at hand we need to do the following:

**Install the liberaries**

- import all the necessary libraries
- import pandas
- import numpy
- import NLTK
- import spaCy
- import sklearn

**Data Prpcessomg**

Before we process the text.  We processes the text to improve the performance of the model\n or to turn the word and charcter into a format the model can understand.


**Stemming and lemmatization**

Stemming is process of converting words to their base forms using heuristic rules.
Lemmatization is a more formal way to find roots by analyzing a word’s morphology using vocabulary from a dictionary.


**Sentence segmentation**

Breaks a large piece of text into linguistically meaningful sentence units.

**Stop word removal**

Remove the most commonly occurring words that don’t add much information to the text.

**Tokenization**

Splits text into individual words and word fragments. The result generally consists of a word index and tokenized text\nin which words may be represented as numerical tokens for use in various deep learning methods


**Feature Extraction**

 Describe a document in relation to the corpus that contains it – created by either Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF



**TF-IDF**

In Bag-of-Words, we count the occurrence of each word or n-gram in a document.

**Word2Vec**

Uses a neural network to learn high-dimensional word embeddings from raw text. It comes in two variations: Skip-Gram, in which we try to predict surrounding words given a target word.

**Machine learning NLP techniques**

 - Logistic regression
   To predict the probability that an event will occur based on some input. can be applied to solve sentiment analysis problems
 - Naive Bayes
   Algorithm that finds the conditional probability distribution
 - 
**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**

 To view a document as a collection of topics and a topic as a collection of words.

**Deep learning NLP Techniques:**  
   - RNN
 
   deep learning process words in close proximity using n-grams
   
**Issues**
  - None
**Contribution**
   -  For major change, please open an issue first discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure you update test as appropriate.
